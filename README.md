                         ---- HADEV ----

This project contains the Openstack and Floodlight changes.

The aim of the project is to have HA for cloud applications 
and at the same time to ensure high level of QoS. A seperate 
module is implemented on Floodlight to take care of QoS requirements.

The Mininet tests used for evaluation are located in the mininet folder.
